## Raspberry Pi 4

Raspberry Pi 4, at the moment of writing this, has a limited KMS driver, and a buggy "fake" kms driver. This is because the GPU is different from the previous ones. Instead of using the `vc` libraries, you will need to use the DRM/GBM.

**What do I need?**

You need a GCC compiler, GDM, EGL, and GLES libraries. The GCC compiler is already included in the Raspbian image. To install the other libraries, simply run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libegl1-mesa-dev libgbm-dev libgles2-mesa-dev
```

You will also need to connect your Raspberry Pi to a screen. The boot config from `/boot/config.txt` that I have used for my tests, if it helps in any way:

```bash
dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d
max_framebuffers=2
hdmi_force_hotplug=1
hdmi_group=2
hdmi_mode=81
```

**How do I try it?**

Copy or download the `triangle_rpi4.c` file onto your Raspberry Pi. Using any terminal, write the following commands to compile the source file:

```
gcc -o triangle_rpi4 triangle_rpi4.c -ldrm -lgbm -lEGL -lGLESv2 -I/usr/include/libdrm -I/usr/include/GLES2
```

To run the executable, type the following:

```
./triangle_rpi4
```

You should see the following output:

```
resolution: 1366x768
Initialized EGL version: 1.4
GL Viewport size: 1366x768
```

At the same time, a new file should be created: `output.raw`. This file contains raw 1366x768 RGB pixels. You can use Photoshop or any other software to import and view this file. You should be able to see the following purple triangle. Please note that the image is mirrored vertically as the pixel coordinates in OpenGL start from the bottom, not from the top. Example of the image:

## Troubleshooting and Questions

**Failed to get EGL version! Error:**

Your EGL might be faulty! Make sure you are using the libraries provided by Raspbian and not the ones installed through apt-get or other package managers. Use the ones in the `/opt/vc/lib` folder. If that does not work, try reinstalling your Raspberry Pi OS.

**I get "Error! The glViewport/glGetIntegerv are not working! EGL might be faulty!" What should I do?**

Same as above.

**How do I change the pixelbuffer resolution?**

Find `pbufferAttribs` and change `EGL_WIDTH` and `EGL_HEIGHT`.

**I get "undefined reference" on some gl functions!**

Some GL functions may not come from GLES library. You may need to get GL1 library by executing `sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev` and then simply add: `-lGL` flag to the linker, so you get: `gcc -o triangle triangle.o -lbrcmEGL -lbrcmGLESv2 -lGL -L/opt/vc/lib`

**How do I change the buffer sample size or the depth buffer size or the stencil size?**

Find `configAttribs` at the top of the `triangle.c` file and modify the attributes you need. All config attributes are located here <https://www.khronos.org/registry/EGL/sdk/docs/man/html/eglChooseConfig.xhtml>

**Can I use glBegin() and glEnd()?**

You should not, but you can. However, it seems that OpenGL ES does not like that and nothing will be rendered. For this you will need to link the `GL` library as well. Simply, add `-lGL` to the gcc command.

**Failed to add service - already in use?**

As mentioned in [this issue](https://github.com/matusnovak/rpi-opengl-without-x/issues/1), you have to remove both `vc4-kms-v3d` and `vc4-fkms-v3d` from [R-Pi config](https://elinux.org/R-Pi_configuration_file). Also relevant discussion here: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40490113/eglfs-on-raspberry2-failed-to-add-service-already-in-use>. If you are using Raspberry Pi 4 (the `triangle_rpi4.c`) it might happen sometimes. I could not fully figure it out, but it might be due to incorrect EGL or DRM/GBM cleanup in  the code. I say "incorrect", but I don't know where.
