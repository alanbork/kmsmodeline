Whether by design or by oversight, it turns out the kms/drm driver architecture used in linux to set the current video mode allows easy selection of custom modes as well. You just stuff the values you want into the mode structure returned by getConnector, and then tell drm to use that mode. Because this is close to the metal you can't just say height, width, and refresh, but need to specify the full timing info like you would using xorg's modelines.

This complete example takes a xorg compliant modeline and stuffs it into the proper fields of the mode structure. It has been tested on the raspberry pi 4. As a debugging tool, it can also dump the modelines of the modes detected by kms/linux for your monitor. 

disclaimer: there may well be more proper ways to do this, I haven't read the docs to see.

**Raspberry Pi 4 note**

This code works with the FKMS and KMS drivers on the raspberry Pi (4). At the moment of writing this the pi4 has a limited KMS driver, and a buggy "fake" kms driver. This is because the GPU is different from the previous ones. Instead of using the `vc` libraries, you will need to use the DRM/GBM libraries which is what this code does.

**What do I need?**

You need a GCC compiler, GDM, EGL, and GLES libraries. The GCC compiler is already included in the Raspbian image. To install the other libraries, simply run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libegl1-mesa-dev libgbm-dev libgles2-mesa-dev libdrm-dev
```

You will also need to connect your Raspberry Pi to a screen. The boot config from `/boot/config.txt` that I have used for my tests, if it helps in any way:

```bash
dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d
max_framebuffers=2
hdmi_force_hotplug=1
hdmi_group=2
hdmi_mode=81
```

**How do I try it?**

Copy or download the `kmsmodeline.c` file onto your Raspberry Pi. Using any terminal, write the following commands to compile the source file:

```
gcc -o kmsmodeline kmsmodeline.c -ldrm -lgbm -lEGL -lGLESv2 -I/usr/include/libdrm -I/usr/include/GLES2
```

To run the executable, type the following:

```
kmsmodeline <mode number>
kmsmodeline <mode number> "xorg modeline", eg:
kmsmodeline 31 "13.514000 720 739 801 858 480 488 494 525 -hsync -vsync interlace dblclk"
```

You should see the following output:

```
% kmsmodeline 31 
/dev/dri/card0 does not have DRM resources, using card1
720x480i-60.00hz(60): 13.514000 720 739 801 858 480 488 494 525 -hsync -vsync interlace dblclk
Initialized EGL version: 1.4

```

The program will briefly show the following full screen:

* 4 seconds of warming up the screen to wait for the monitor to finish switching modes

* 60 frames of black white full screen flicker.

* timing for each buffer flip, eg
````
16.69 ms        59.90 hz
16.64 ms        60.10 hz
16.69 ms        59.91 hz
16.64 ms        60.10 hz
[....]
````
(note that buffer flips can but need not be tied to vsync. if vsync is what you need this is probably the only proper way to go: https://github.com/dvdhrm/docs/blob/master/drm-howto/modeset-vsync.c)

## Troubleshooting and Questions

**Failed to get EGL version! Error:**

Your EGL might be faulty! Make sure you are using the libraries provided by Raspbian and not the ones installed through apt-get or other package managers. Use the ones in the `/opt/vc/lib` folder. If that does not work, try reinstalling your Raspberry Pi OS.

**I get "Error! The glViewport/glGetIntegerv are not working! EGL might be faulty!" What should I do?**

Same as above.
